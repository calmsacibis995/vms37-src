!
! FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION:
!
!	This routine maps the specified virtual blocks to their
!	corresponding logical blocks using the supplied window.
!	the window is turned if necessary.
!
! CALLING SEQUENCE:
!	MAP_VBN (ARG1, ARG2, ARG3, ARG4)
!
! INPUT PARAMETERS:
!	ARG1: desired VBN
!	ARG2: address of window to use
!	ARG3: number of blocks to map
!		if not present, 1
!
! IMPLICIT INPUTS:
!	CURRENT_VCB: address of VCB in process
!	CURRENT_UCB: address of UCB in process
!
! OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
!	ARG4: if present, addres to store number of unmapped blocks
!
! IMPLICIT OUTPUTS:
!	NONE
!
! ROUTINE VALUE:
!	starting LBN or -1 if no map
!
! SIDE EFFECTS:
!	window may be turned, header may be read, volume may be switched

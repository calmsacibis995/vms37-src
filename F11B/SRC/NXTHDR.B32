!
! FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION:
!
!	This routine reads the next extension header, if any, of the
!	indicated file. Extension data is taked from either the indicated
!	file header or the arguments.
!
!
! CALLING SEQUENCE:
!	NEXT_HEADER (ARG1, ARG2, ARG3, ARG4)
!
! INPUT PARAMETERS:
!	ARG1: address of current file header or 0
!	ARG2: address of corresponding FCB or zero
!	ARG3: extension file ID, if present
!	ARG4: extension segment number, if present
!
! IMPLICIT INPUTS:
!	NONE
!
! OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
!	NONE
!
! IMPLICIT OUTPUTS:
!	NONE
!
! ROUTINE VALUE:
!	Address of header read or 0 if none
!
! SIDE EFFECTS:
!	File header may be read

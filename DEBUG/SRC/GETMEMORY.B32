! MODULE FUNCTION
!	This module contains the Debugger's Free Memory Manager, i.e. all the
!	routines which initialize the free memory pool and allocate and dealloc-
!	ate memory blocks.  These memory blocks are used for RST entries, Static
!	Address Table entries, and most other descriptors used in the Debugger.

GLOBAL ROUTINE DBG$CHECK_MEMORY: NOVALUE =
!
! FUNCTION
!	This routine checks the Debugger's memory pool for integrity.  A com-
!	plete scan is made over the entire memory pool to check that every free
!	and allocated block has the proper format.  A second complete scan is
!	made over the entire memory pool free-list to verify that every free
!	block has the proper format and that the list is intact.  A third com-
!	plete scan is made over the "temporary block" list, and each such block
!	is checked for validity and consistency.  If any error is detected in
!	any of these scans, an error is signalled (Internal Memory Error) which
!	prints the address of the bad memory block.  If the memory pool is found
!	to be correct, the routine returns normally.

!	which the free block is linked into the memory pool free-list.
!
!	This routine may be called during the Debugger's initialization phase,
!	but not after the Debugger has given the user program control.  The
!	reason is that memory expansions after the user program has started can
!	cause checkerboarding of the Debugger's and the user's memory which may

GLOBAL ROUTINE DBG$GET_MEMORY(SIZE) =
!
! FUNCTION
!	This routine allocates a memory block of a specified size and returns
!	the block's address to the caller.  The block contents is zeroed out
!	before being returned.  This is the primary routine for getting memory
!	blocks from the free memory pool.
!
!	The routine uses the First-Fit algorithm for finding a free memory
!	block.  The free-list is thus searched until a free block which is
!	large enough is encountered.  That block is then split into two pieces,
!	one to be allocated to the caller and one to remain on the free list.
!	This splitting does not occur unless the remainder is large enough to
!	be a free block (four longwords minimum).
!
!	If no free block of adequate size is found, an attempt is made to remove
!	the Run-Time Symbol Table (RST) of the Least Recently Used module.  If
!	this succeeds (i.e., if there is such a module and it's not the only RST
!	module), the free-list search is tried again.  This is repeated until
!	there are no more modules to be released except the Most Recently Used
!	one.  For this reason, the Debugger should never run out of free memory
!	under normal circumstances--the used memory is instead recycled.
!
!	However, if a free block of adequate size still cannot be found, an
!	error is signalled unless a second parameter is present.  If a second
!	parameter is present (e.g., ADDR = DBG$GET_MEMORY(.SIZE, 0);), a zero
!	is returned as the routine value.
!
! INPUTS
!	SIZE	- The size of the desired memory block in longwords.  This is
!		  is the number of longwords to be allocated.
!
!	An optional second parameter specifies that a zero should be returned
!		  if no block can be found to accommodate the request.  The
!		  actual value of the parameter is not significant.  If this
!		  parameter is omitted, an error is signalled.
!
! OUTPUTS
!	A memory block of the desired size is allocated and its address is
!		  returned as the routine's value.  If a second parameter is
!		  specified and no block is found, zero is returned.

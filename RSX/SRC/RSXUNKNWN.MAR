;	COMPRISES THE SHARABLE IMAGE RSXUSR AS DISTRIBUTED IN THE STANDARD
;	AME.  THIS SHARABLE IMAGE CAN BE REPLACED IN THE FIELD WITH ANOTHER
;	SHARABLE IMAGE WHICH HANDLES SPECIFIC DIRECTIVE CODES.

;	THIS ROUTINE RECEIVES CONTROL ON ATTEMPTING TO DISPATCH
;	A DIRECTIVE CODE (DIC) WHICH IS NOT HANDLED BY THE STANDARD
;	AME.  THIS ROUTINE COMPRISES THE SHARABLE IMAGE RSXUSR WHICH
;	CAN BE REPLACED BY ANOTHER SHARABLE IMAGE OF SIMILIAR FORMAT
;	WHICH RECOGNIZES A SPECIFIC SET OF DIRECTIVE CODES.  THIS
;	ROUTINE MUST SET THE DSW TO IE.SDP FOR ANY DIRECTIVES WHICH
;	ARE NOT PROCESSED HERE.

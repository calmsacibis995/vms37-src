;	UETP unit block definitions

; The following definitions are used in multiple unit number device tests in
; UETP.  They specify offsets into a structure dynamically allocated in the
; device test for each unit number associated with a given controller.

	$STRUCT UETUNT

	F	FLINK,L		; Forward link to the next unit block
	F	BLINK,L		; Backward link to the previous unit block
	F	TYPE,B		; Type of structure field
	F	SIZE,W		; Size of the structure excluding data buffers
	F	FLAGS,B		; Flags byte
	V <M			; Flag values
		DONE		; Done testing the unit
		TESTABLE	; This unit is testable
		>
	F	CHAN,W		; Device channel number
	F	FUNC,W		; Device function last executed by this unit

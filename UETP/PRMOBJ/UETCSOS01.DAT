This is the first line
of a file to try out SOS.
Chokeberries, Persimmon Seeds, Mangoes.
Apples, Pears, Plums, Cherries.
Here is the fifth line.
The sixth line.
And the seventh.
My little persimmon seed.
The singed shores, the bears who talk,
The beasts who roam 5-5.
There once was a Swede named Andersraag, first name Alex,
Who invented a band which tells time when touching your wrist.
In fact, they called it Alex Andersraag Time band.

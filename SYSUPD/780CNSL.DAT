! 780CNSL.DAT	- data file to build an 11/780 console floppy
!
! This data file is used by the command procedure CONSOLBLD.COM to
! define 11/780-specific console data.
!
! RECORD FORMAT:
!
!	- Records beginning with "!" are treated as comments.
!	- Records beginning with "$" are executed as DCL commands.
!	- All other records are file names.
!
! The data file is responsible for:
! 	- setting the default directory.
!	- defining the smbols SRC_FLX_SWITCH$ and DST_FLX_SWITCH$.  These
!	  symbols contain FILEX switches necessary to convert data from
!	  Files-11 format (on the source disk) to RT-11 format (on the
!	  console device).  The switches used are:
!		/RT - file is in RT-11 format
!		/RS - file is in ODS-2 format
!		/IM - file is an image file
!
! The command file is responsible for:
!	- defining the symbol CMDSRC to be the source Files-11 disk and
!	  directory where the boot command files, etc. are kept.
!	- defining the symbol VMBSRC to be the source Files-11 disk and
!	  directory where VMB.EXE is kept.
! 	- defining the symbol TARGET to be the name of the console device.

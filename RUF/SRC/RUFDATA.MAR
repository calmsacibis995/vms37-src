; Facility:
;	Recovery Unit Management Facility
;++
; Abstract:
;	This module contains the Recovery Unit Management Facility (RUF)
;	local data storage.
;	These services represent the user-accesible
;	portion of the RUF. These services implement the RUF, with help
;	from the recoverable facilities (RMS,DBMS,TPSS,...) that have been
;	implemented to co-operate with RUF.

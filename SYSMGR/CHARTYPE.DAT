	This file is used by the CLI print queue commands
	(ex. PRINT, SET QUEUE, START/QUEUE, INIT/QUEUE)
	to convert characteristics alpha-numeric strings to binary
	values used by the job controller for scheduling the
	printing of jobs.  Only lines that start with a "%"
	are examined for characteristics information.  Any other
	data in this file is ignored.  Match is done on the
	the basis of the substring entered matching with the
	name field in the entry.  Therefore, the command:
 
		$ PRINT	/CHARACTERISTICS=F MYFILE
 
	will match the first characteristic that starts with a "F".
	No ambiguity checks are made.
 
	Characteristic entries have the following format:
 
%	characteristic_name	associated_numeric_value	comments
 
	For example:
 
%	NORMAL	0		the normal line printer

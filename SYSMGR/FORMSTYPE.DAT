	This file is used by the various CLI utility programs
	to convert forms type alpha/numeric strings to binary
	values used by the job controller for schedualling
	the print of jobs.  Only lines that start with a "%"
	are examined for forms type information.  Any other
	data in this file is ignored.  Match is done on the
	the basis of subtring entered matching with the name
	field in the entry.  Therefore, entering:
 
		/FORMS=F
 
	will match the first form type that starts with a "F".
	No ambiguity checks are made.
 
	Form entries have the following format:
 
%	form_name	associated_numeric_value	comments
 
	For example:
 
%	NORMAL	0		the normal line printer paper

; FACILITY:	System bootstrapping and initialization
;
; ABSTRACT:	Define interface between SYSBOOT and INIT for passing
;		bootstrap parameters.
;
; ENVIRONMENT:	This module is linked against SYSBOOT and against INIT; it
;		shares both of their environments.
;
; AUTHOR:  TRUDY MATTHEWS,	CREATION DATE: 07-Jan-1981
;
; MODIFIED BY:
;
;	V02-005 RIH0084		Richard I. Hustvedt	19-Jan-1982
;		Add entries for small request packet lookaside list.
;
;	V02-004	KTA0036		Kerbey T. Altmann	07-Oct-1981
;		Add entries for SCS load code, port microcode and
;		driver addresses, and SCS systemid.
;
;	V02-003	PHL0010		Peter H. Lipman		30-May-1981
;		Remove "BOO_" global definitions, replace by BOODEF
;		in SYSDEF.MDL and invoke where needed.
;
;		Delete BOO$GQ_SYSSTAT.  SYS.EXE is no longer required
;		to be a contiguous file.
;
;	V02-002	PHL0009		Peter H. Lipman		30-Apr-1981
;		Add BOOT control block parameter and offsets.
;		This area contains code and data to allow SYS.EXE 
;		and SYSDUMP.DMP to be non-contiguous.
;
;	V02-001	PHL0007		Peter H. Lipman		25-Mar-1981
;		IRP and LRP lists are now allocated from pool in
;		SYSBOOT.  New communication cells are in this module
;		for this and the FILEREAD cache.  SYSBOOT now reads in
;		all the files it "opens" with FIL$OPENFILE and leaves
;		their pool addresses in communication cells in this module.

; This module reserves storage for bootstrap parameters to be passed from
; SYSBOOT to INIT.  In many ways, this module functions like SYSPARAM does:
;	- It is linked both into SYSBOOT.EXE and SYS.EXE.
;	- SYSBOOT fills in its copy of this module with derived values, then
;	  copies this "parameter block" into the reserved space linked into
;	  INIT.
; This module differs from SYSPARAM in that SYSPARAM parameters stay in the
; system after INIT has deleted itself;  BOOPARAM paramters are used only by
; INIT and are deleted along with INIT.
;--

;
; Put the data in a psect contiguous to INIT's Z$INIT000 psect, so INIT can
; define a symbol unique to SYS.EXE for the base of this module.

.FACILITY EVL,512/SYSTEM

.SEVERITY ERROR

!
!	Each of the following messages may be generated by EVL.
!	A brief description follows each message giving the reason for
!	the failure and its possible remedy if appropriate.
!
!	Secondary messages are printed to give more information about a
!	failure.  Sometimes the secondary messages are from EVL itself.
!	More often however the messages are system or RMS messages which
!	detail the failure.
!

OBTEVT		"error when reading raw events"
!
!	An error was returned from the netacp when EVL was reading unprocessed
!	events.  The secondary message may indicate a system configuration
!	or process quota problem with the EVL process.  Make sure the EVL
!	process has adaquate quota and that the VMS system is configured
!	properly.  The account that EVL runs under is specified in the
!	network configuration database.
!

WRTEVT		"error writing events to sink node receiver"
!
!	An error was returned when a write was attempted to a logical link
!	to an event receiver.  The link will be reopened and the write will
!	be retried.  Many of these errors indicate a misconfigured VMS system
!	or network.
!

OPNSNK		"unable to open link to event receiver"
!
!	An error was returned when EVL attempted to open a logical link to
!	an event receiver on a sink node.  The sink node may not be reachable
!	in the network or the VMS system or network may be misconfigured.
!

RAWFMT		"an invalid raw event was seen, and ignored"
!
!	An invalid raw event was obtained from NETACP.  The event's size
!	exceeded the buffer.  This indicates a bug in network software.
!

EVTSIZ		"an event was too large to translate to DNA form"
!
!	A raw event was too large to format properly into DECnet standard
!	form.  It has been discarded.  This indicates a bug in network
!	software.
!

READEVT		"error reading processed event record"
!
!	An error was encountered while reading incoming event records
!	by the receiver.  An event has been discarded.
!

BRDCST/FAO=1	"unable to write to console device !AS"
!
!	An error was encountered writing to the console sink.  The
!	event is discarded.
!

OPENMON/FAO=1	"error creating logical link to monitor process !AS"
!
!	An error was encountered establishing a logical link to
!	a sink monitor process.  All events destined for that sink
!	will be discarded.  The monitor image or command file may
!	not be present.

WRITEMON/FAO=1	"error writing event record to monitor process !AS"
!
!	An error was encountered writing an event record to a
!	sink monitor process.  The link will be reestablished to
!	the monitor process.
!	

CLOSEMON/FAO=1	<error disconnecting monitor process "!AS">
!
!	An error was encountered disconnecting a monitor process.

OPENFILE/FAO=1	<error creating event file "!AS">
!
!	An error was encountered creating an event file.  All events
!	destined for that sink will be discarded.

WRITEFILE/FAO=1	<error writing event file "!AS">
!
!	An error was encountered writing an event record to a
!	file.  All events destined for that sink will be discarded.

CLOSEFILE/FAO=1	<error closing event file "!AS">
!
!	An error was encountered closing an event file.

BADTYPE/FAO=1	"illegal sink type !UL, record ignored"
!
!	An event record was received by the event receiver which
!	had an illegal sink type.  The record was ignored.

BADPARAM	"improperly coded NICE parameter"
!
!	An improperly coded NICE parameter was detected by the event
!	receiver.  The parameter is not displayed.


!
!	The following severe errors indicate misconfiguration problems
!	with the VMS system or the DECnet software or bugs in network
!	software.  Secondary error messages should indicate the course
!	of action to follow to correct misconfigurations.  Suspect
!	process quotas and privileges for the EVL process. Also SYSGEN
!	parameters which may effect the function of NETACP or the EVL
!	process.
!

.SEVERITY SEVERE

NETASN		"unable to assign a channel to NET"
!
!	An $ASSIGN system service failed to assign a channel to the network.
!

NETDAS		"error deassigning a channel to the device NET"
!
!	An error occurred when EVL attempted to deassign a channel to
!	break a link with the event receiver.
!

INSFVM		"unable to obtain virtual memory"
!
!	A program bug or system configuration problem caused virtual memory
!	to become exhausted.  Check the value of the VIRTUALPAGECNT
!	parameter to SYSGEN and if it is 2048 or greater then the message
!	is caused by a program bug.
!

WKQERR		"an error was returned from a work queue management routine"
!
!	One of the work queue management routines returned an error.  This
!	error is not expected and indicates a program bug or a vms system
!	configuration problem.  Check the maximum virtual memory allowed for
!	the process and the timer element quota.  There needs to be one timer
!	queue element for each sink node in use and a couple of spares.
!

ACPSHO		"an error was returned from an NETACP show function"
!
!	An unexpected error was returned from a Network show function
!	used to obtain database information from the network.  The probable
!	cause is a software error.  Report the problem and the conditions
!	under which it occurred on an SPR form to DIGITAL.
!

NETSHUT		"network is shutting down, EVL is exiting"
!
!	EVL received notification that the network is shutting down.
!	It is exiting at this time.  This message is expected.
!



.SEVERITY INFORMATIONAL

LOGDBUR/FAO=1	"event receiver data base update at !%D"
DBCRCV/FAO=4	<!AC sink "!AD", state !AC>
!
!	Event receiver has updated its internal database as a result
!	of startup or notification from the NETACP.
!

LOGDBUT/FAO=1	"event transmitter data base update at !%D"
!
!	Event transmitter has updated its internal database as a result
!	of startup or notification from the NETACP.
!

LOGOPNT/FAO=2	"open link to event receiver on node !AS at !%D"
!
!	Event transmitter has attempted to open a link to the event
!	receiver on the  specified node.
!

LOGOPNR/FAO=3	"connect accepted by event receiver from node !AD at !%D"
!
!	Event receiver accepted a link from an event transmitter on
!	the specified node.
!

LOGOPNM/FAO=3	"open link to event monitor !AD at !%D"
!
!	Event receiver opened a link to the event monitor specified.

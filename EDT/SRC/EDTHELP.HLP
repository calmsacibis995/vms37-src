The LINE key advances or backs up the cursor to the nearest beginning
of a line (see ADVANCE and BACKUP). 
 
The OPEN LINE key inserts a carriage return after the cursor and
leaves the cursor position unchanged.  Pressing the OPEN LINE key
when the cursor is at the beginning of the line creates a new blank
line.
3 01
The WORD key moves the cursor forward or backward by a word (see
ADVANCE and BACKUP). 
 
The CHGC key changes the case of a range of characters as follows:
 
	1.  If there is a select range active, the case of each
	    alphabetic character in the select range is changed.
	
	2.  If 1 does not apply and the cursor is positioned on the
	    current search string, the case of each alphabetic 
	    character in the search string is changed.
	
	3.  If 1 and 2 do not apply, then the case of one character
	    is changed, and the cursor moves one character in the
	    current direction.
3 02
The EOL key moves the cursor forward or backward to the nearest end of
line.  
 
The DELETE EOL key deletes all characters to the right of the cursor
in the current line, including the character on which the cursor is
positioned.  
3 03
The CHAR key advances or backs up the cursor by one character  (see
ADVANCE and BACKUP). 
 
The SPECINS key inserts any ASCII character.  Press the GOLD key,
enter the decimal representation of the character, press the GOLD
key again, and press SPECINS. 
3 04
The ADVANCE key sets the current direction to advance for the CHAR,
WORD, LINE, EOL, PAGE, SECTION, SUBSTITUTE, SUBSTITUTE NEXT, FIND
and FIND NEXT keys.  Advance means the movement will occur in the
direction toward the end of the file, that is, to the right and down.   
 
The BOTTOM key positions the cursor at the bottom of the text buffer.
3 05
The BACKUP key sets the cursor direction to backup for the CHAR, WORD,
LINE, EOL, PAGE, SECTION, SUBSTITUTE, SUBSTITUTE NEXT, FIND and FIND
NEXT keys.  Backup means the movement will occur in  the direction of
the beginning of the file, that is, to the left and up. 
	
The TOP key positions the cursor at the top of the text buffer.
3 06
The CUT key deletes the select range, storing it in the paste buffer.
The select range is all the text between the selected position (see
SELECT) and the current cursor position.  If you have not selected a
range and the cursor is positioned on the current search  string, that
string is cut.  The previous contents of the paste buffer is lost. 
 
The PASTE key inserts the contents of the paste buffer directly in
front of the cursor. 
3 07
The PAGE key moves the cursor to the top of a page.  A page is defined
by a delimiter string, which can be set by the SET ENTITY command. The
default page delimiter is the form feed character (CTRL/L).
 
The COMMAND key allows the you to input a line mode command to be
executed.  The command is terminated by pressing the ENTER key on
the keypad.
3 08
The SECTION key moves the cursor 16 lines forward or backward,
depending on the current direction mode (see ADVANCE and BACKUP).
 
The FILL key performs a word fill on the select range.  A word fill
reformats a block of text so that as many full words as possible are
placed on each line without exceeding the right margin.  The right
margin may be set by the SET WRAP command or, if it was not set, the
default is the  terminal width - 1.  For purposes of the FILL
command, only spaces are used as word delimiters. 
3 09
The APPEND key deletes the selected range and adds it to the end of
the paste buffer. The selected range is all the text between the
selected position (see SELECT) and the current cursor position.  If no
select has been done and the cursor is positioned on the current
search  string, that string is appended.  
 
The REPLACE key deletes the select range and replaces it with the
contents of the PASTE buffer.   
3 10
Use the HELP key to obtain help on the editing keypad.
3 11
The FIND NEXT key searches for the next occurrence of the search
string entered by the FIND key.  The direction of the search is the
current direction mode (ADVANCE or BACKUP). 
 
The FIND key searches for an occurrence of a string.  Press the FIND
key and then enter the string from the main keyboard.  End the string
by pressing either the ADVANCE or BACKUP key to set the direction of
the search. 
3 12
The ^ (up arrow) key moves the cursor to the character above.
3 13
The v (down arrow) key moves the cursor to the character below.
3 15
The < (left arrow) key moves the cursor to the preceding character.
3 14
The > (right arrow) key moves the cursor to the next character.
3 16
The SELECT key marks one end of a select range.  A select range is a
block of text on which various operations (such as CUT, APPEND or
FILL) can be performed.  You create a select range by moving the
cursor to either the beginning or the end of the text you wish to
select, pressing the SELECT key, and then moving the cursor to the
opposite end of the text.  You can then perform the desired operation
on the range.
 
The RESET key cancels the effect of the GOLD key if it was 
pressed by mistake, cancels a select range, or terminates any
other partially entered command string.
3 17
The DEL L key deletes text from the cursor position up to the end of
the current line, including the line terminator.  If the cursor is 
positioned at the beginning of a line, the entire line is deleted.
The deleted text is saved in the delete line buffer. 
 
The UND L key inserts the contents of the delete line buffer ahead of
the cursor.  
3 18
The DEL W key deletes text from the cursor to the beginning of the
next word, storing the text in the delete word buffer.   
 
The UND W key inserts the contents of the delete word buffer ahead of
the cursor.   
3 19
The DEL C key deletes the character on which the cursor is positioned 
and saves it in the delete character buffer.  
 
The UND C key inserts the contents of the delete character buffer
ahead of the cursor.  
3 20
The GOLD key lets you use the alternate function of the editing keys.
Press the GOLD key first and then the key you wish to use.
 
You can also use the GOLD key to enter repeat counts.  Press GOLD
and then the main keyboard numeric keys, followed by the key to be
repeated.  The DELETE key and CTRL/U may be used to edit the repeat
count, and thus cannot be repeated in this manner.
3 21
The ENTER key terminates the input of commands.
 
The SUBS key deletes the search string, replaces it with the contents 
of the paste buffer, and finds the next occurrence of the string.  For
multiple substitutions, use the following sequence of commands:
 
	1.  Press SELECT.
	2.  Type the new text.
	3.  Press CUT.
	4.  Press FIND.
	5.  Enter the text you wish to replace.
	
Each time you press SUBSTITUTE, EDT makes one substitution and finds the
next occurrence of the search string.  You can use a repeat count for
multiple substitutions.
3 45
The tab compute key is used when structured tabs are enabled to compute
the indentation level from the cursor position.  If the cursor position
is not a multiple of the the tab size, an error occurs.
3 48
The tab decrease key is used when structured tabs are enabled to decrease
the indentation level counter.
3 49
The tab increase key is used when structured tabs are enabled to increase
the indentation level counter.
3 52
The beginning of line key moves the cursor to the beginning of the current
line.  If the cursor is already on the beginning of a line, it moves to
the previous line.
3 54
The delete to beginning of word key is used to delete all character from
the cursor position to the beginning of the word containing the cursor.
If the cursor is on the first character of a word the previous word is
deleted.
3 55
The DEFINE KEY key is used to define a new function for an editing key.
The user is prompted first to press the key to be defined, then to
enter the definition.  The key can be defined either in terms of other
editing keys or by use of change mode subcommands.  If you use an editing
key, its definition appears at the bottom of the screen.
3 64
The tab adjust key is used when structured tabs are enabled to adjust
the tab level of the select range.  The key is used as follows:

	1.  Create a select range of the text you wish to adjust.
	
	2.  Enter a repeat count by using the GOLD key.  A minus sign
	    should preceed the count if you wish to decrease the tab
	    level.  If you do not use a repeat count, it defaults to 1.
	
	3.  Use the tab adjust key.
	
The effect of the key is to increase or decrease the indentation level
of the select range by the number of tabs indicated by the repeat count.
3 65
The delete to beginning of line key is used to delete all characters
in the current line to the left of the cursor.  If the cursor is on
the first character of a line, the entire previous line is deleted.
3 70
The exit key returns you to line mode editing.

1 CLEAR
The CLEAR (abbreviation: CL) command provides an efficient means of 
deleting all the text in a buffer.

Format:		CLEAR buffer-name

All the text in the specified buffer is deleted. (Note that the argument
is a buffer-name, not a range specification. CLEAR PASTE is valid, while
CLEAR =PASTE and CLEAR BUFFER PASTE are not.) 
1 CHANGE
The CHANGE command puts EDT in change mode. Use change mode to
edit at the character level rather than the line level.  

Format:		CHANGE [range]

The optional range specifies the cursor position when you
enter change mode.  If you omit range, the current position
is used.

There are three submodes of change mode.  Which submode you use
depends on the type of terminal you are using and whether or not you
wish to use the auxiliary (numeric) keypad for editing commands.  These
modes are:  

        1.  Hardcopy mode
        2.  Keypad mode
        3.  Nokeypad mode
2 ENTITIES
Entities are used in change mode subcommands to specify the text on 
which a subcommand will operate.  Each entity represents a portion of 
text, which may be anything from a single character to an entire text 
buffer.  Most entities can be preceded by a count, which indicates the
number of  entities to be affected.
3 CHARACTER
The character entity is specified by the letter C.  It selects a 
single character of text.
3 WORD
A word consists of a string of characters terminated by a set of
delimiter characters.  The default delimiter characters are spaces,
tabs, carriage returns, line feeds, form feeds, and vertical tabs.
Spaces are handled in a special way:  all spaces following a word
up to the first non-space character are considered part of a word.
Other delimiters are not considered a part of the word they terminate.
Rather, they are considered to be words by themselves.  There are
three word entities: 

        W    Specifies the entire word in which the cursor is 
	     positioned.
 
	BW   Specifies all characters to the left of the cursor up
	     to the beginning of the word.
 
	EW   Specifies all characters from the cursor through the end
	     of the word.

You can change the word delimiters with the SET ENTITY command.
3 LINE
The line entities are:

	L    Specifies the entire line in which the cursor is 
	     positioned.
 
	BL   Specifies all characters to the left of the cursor up to 
	     the beginning of a line.  (When the cursor is 
             positioned at the beginning of a line, the BL entity selects 
             the entire previous line.)
 
	EL   Specifies all characters from the cursor to the end of a
	     line, including the character on which the cursor is
	     positioned. (If the cursor is on a line 
	     terminator, the entire next line is selected.)
 
	NL   Specifies all characters from the cursor to the beginning 
	     of the next line, including the character on which the 
	     cursor is positioned.
3 RANGE
The range entities specify all text in the buffer either before or
after the cursor.  The two range entities are:

	BR   Specifies the text from the cursor position to the 
	     beginning of the buffer.
 
	ER   Specifies the text from the cursor position to the end 
	     of the buffer.
3 SENTENCE
A sentence consists of a string of characters terminated by one of a
set of single character delimiters.  The default sentence delimiters
are '.', '?', and  '!'.  A sentence delimiter is considered to be a
delimiter only if it is at the end of a line or if it is followed by a
space.  The line terminator or trailing spaces are considered a
part of the sentence. There are three sentence entities:   

	SEN    Specifies the entire sentence in which the cursor is 
	       positioned, including the delimiter and trailing spaces
	       or line terminator.
 
	BSEN   Specifies all characters in the current sentence to the 
	       left of the cursor.
 
	ESEN   Specifies all characters in the current sentence from 
	       the cursor to (but not including) the delimiter 
	       character.

The sentence delimiters can be changed by the SET ENTITY command.
3 PAGE
A page consists of all the text between two page delimiters, including
the  trailing page delimiter.  The default page delimiter is the form
feed  character.  There are three page entities: 

	PAGE    Specifies all of the current page.
 
	BPAGE   Specifies all characters in the current page from the
		character to the left of the cursor to the beginning 
		of the page.
 
	EPAGE   Specifies all characters in the current page from the 
	        cursor to (but not including) the page delimiter.

You can change the page delimiter with the SET ENTITY command.
3 PARAGRAPH
A paragraph consists of all the text between two paragraph delimiters,
including the trailing paragraph delimiter.  The default paragraph
delimiter is two consecutive line terminators.

There are three paragraph entities:  

	PAR    Specifies all of the current paragraph.
 
	BPAR   Specifies all characters in the current paragraph from 
	       the character preceding the cursor to the beginning of 
	       the paragraph.
 
	EPAR   Specifies all characters in the current paragraph from 
	       the cursor to (but not including) the paragraph
	       delimiter.

You can change the paragraph delimiter with the SET ENTITY command.
3 SELECT
The select entity consists of all characters between the cursor and   
the select mark.  The select mark must have been specified previously
by a SEL subcommand.  If no select mark is active and the cursor is
positioned on the current search string, the search string is 
selected.  The select range entity is specified by SR. 
3 VERTICAL
The vertical line entity is the same as the line entity, except that
with the V entity, the cursor stays in the same column.  The vertical
entity is specified by V.
3 STRING
The string entity consists of all the characters between the cursor 
and the next occurrence of a specified search string.  Specify the
string entity by enclosing the desired search string in single
or double quotes.  If the string is null (specified by '' or ""), the
previous search string is used again.

For key definitions, the null character (ASCII character 0) may be
used in place of the quote characters to avoid conflicts with the
search string the user enters.
2 HARDCOPY
On a hardcopy terminal, change mode operates as follows. When you
enter change mode, the EDT displays the current line on the terminal.
The cursor position is marked by bracketing the character on which the
cursor is positioned.  EDT will then prompt with the characters: 

C*

In response, you type a series of change mode subcommands terminated
by a carrige return.  EDT will execute the commands and retype the
line. 
2 KEYPAD
You enter the keypad submode of change mode when your terminal is a
VT52 or VT100 and the KEYPAD option is on.  (This option is on by 
default.)  In this submode, the terminal screen is used as a window
into the text buffer.  Characters typed on the main keyboard are
inserted into the buffer at the cursor position.  You enter editing
commands by using keys on the auxiliary keypad, or control keys on the
main keyboard. 
 
For more help on keypad mode, type CHANGE to enter that 
mode.  Use the keypad HELP facility as follows:

     1.  If your terminal is a VT100, press the keypad
         key marked "PF2".

     2.  If your terminal is a VT52, press the red keypad
         key.
2 SCREEN
You enter the screen submode of change mode if your terminal is not
a VT52 or VT100 or your terminal is a VT52 or VT100 and the SET NOKEYPAD
command has been used to turn off the keypad option.  The screen is
used as a window into the text buffer. Change mode commands are typed from
the keyboard and echoed on the bottom line of the screen. The commands
are executed and the text on the screen is updated whenever a carriage
return is typed. 
2 SUBCOMMANDS
When EDT is in change mode, a distinct set of commands is accepted.  These
are called the change mode subcommands.  Do not abbreviate the subcommands
or include spaces within a single command. A string of subcommands may be
concatenated with zero or more spaces separating them. 
 
Subcommands take one of the following forms, depending on the 
particular command:
 
	A.  command
 
	B.  [+|-] [count] command
 
	C.  [+|-] [count] [command] [+|-] [count] [+|-] entity [=buffer]
 
Whenever a sign can appear in more than one place, the last sign
specified is used to determine the direction. 

A sequence of subcommands can also be enclosed in parentheses to form
a single unit.  A numeric literal preceding the left parenthesis indicates
the number of times to repeat the entire sequence.
3 ADVANCE
The ADVANCE command sets the current cursor direction to advance.  The 
current direction is used by many subcommands to determine whether
entities to the left or to the right of the cursor are to be affected.
When the direction is advance, the cursor character and characters to
the right are affected by subcommands. 
 
Format:		ADV
3 APPEND
The APPEND command works in the same way as the CUT command (see)
except that the new text is added to the end of the alternate
buffer instead of  replacing its contents. 
 
Format:		[+|-] [count] APPEND [+|-] [count] [+|-] entity [=buffer]
3 ASCII
The ASCII subcommand inserts a specified ASCII character
into the buffer at the cursor position.  Use the count field
to indicate the decimal value of the ASCII character you want
to insert.
 
Format:		[count] ASCII
 
The ASCII command is the only way to insert a carriage return 
character in the middle of a line of text; otherwise, insert commands
always treat the carriage return as a line terminator.  The following
command would insert a carriage return character: 
 
	13ASC	(13 is the ASCII code for carriage return)
3 BACKUP
The BACKUP command sets the current cursor direction to backup.  The 
current direction is used by many subcommands to determine whether
entities to the left or to the right of the cursor are to be affected.
When the direction is backup, characters to the left of the cursor
are affected.  
 
Format: 	BACK
3 CHGC
The CHGC command changes the case of every alphabetic character
in the specified number of entities - lower case characters become
upper case and upper case become lower.

Format:		[+|-] [count] CHGC [+|-] [count] [+|-] entity
3 CUT
The CUT command deletes a specified number of entities and
saves all the deleted text in an alternate text buffer.  The command
works exactly like the DELETE command except that the text is saved.
 
Format:		[+|-] [count] CUT [+|-] [count] [+|-] entity [=buffer]
 
If you do not specify a buffer, the buffer named PASTE is used.
 
Ex:	CUTSR	Cut the selected range
 
	CUTPAGE	Cut the current page of text
3 DEFK
The DEFK command is used to assign new definitions to editing keys.
The user is prompted first to press the key to be defined, then to
enter the definition.  The key can be defined either in terms of other
editing keys or by use of change mode subcommands.  If you use an editing
key, its definition appears at the bottom of the screen.  This command
should only be executed while in keypad change mode.

Format:		DEFK
3 DELETE
The DELETE subcommand deletes a specified number of 
entities.
 
Format:		[+|-] [repeat-count] D [+|-] [count] [+|-] entity
 
If the entity is C, W, BW, EW, L, BL, EL, or NL, the last entity
deleted by the command is saved in the delete buffer associated with
the entity and can be restored by use of the UNDELETE C, W, or L
subcommand.  
 
Ex:	D15C	Deletes 15 characters in the current direction.
 
	DSR	Deletes the select range.
 
	DBR	Deletes to the beginning of the buffer.
	
	D'ABC'	Deletes all characters from the cursor up to the first 
		occurrence of the string 'ABC' but not including the
		string.
3 EXIT
The EXIT command exits change mode (not the editor).  When  the exit
command is executed, you return to line mode.  
 
Format:		EX
3 EXTEND
The EXTEND command executes a line mode command while you
are in change mode.  EDT interprets the remainder of the command line as a
line mode command, executes the command, and reenters change mode
automatically. 
 
Format:		EXT line mode command
3 FILL
The FILL command reformats a block of text so that as many
complete words as possible are placed on each line without exceeding
the right margin.  The right margin is set to the terminal width minus 1
character by default or may be changed by the SET WRAP command.  
 
Format:		[+|-] [count] FILL [+|-] [count] [+|-] entity
3 HELP
The HELP command causes a diagram of keypad functions and CONTROL key
descriptions to appear on the screen.  If executed in keypad change
mode, additional information can be obtained by pressing keypad or
control keys; in nokeypad mode, pressing any subsequent key returns
to editing mode.
3 INSERT
The INSERT command inserts new text into the buffer at the 
current cursor position.
 
Format:		I text to be inserted ^Z
 
This command behaves differently in each of the modes:

     o  In keypad mode, insert text by typing on the main
        keyboard; you do not need to begin the insert with 
        I or end it with ^Z.

     o  In nokeypad mode, type I to begin inserting text.
        You can insert text from the keyboard until you enter
        ^Z; you can enter one or more lines of text.

     o  In hardcopy mode, type I to begin inserting text.
        You can insert text from the keyboard until you
        enter either a ^Z or a carriage return.
3 KS
The KS command modifies the cursor position after a PASTE command.

Format:		KS

After a PASTE command, the cursor is on the character to the right of the
pasted text.  If KS follows a PASTE, however, the cursor is on the last
pasted character if the current direction is advance and on the first
pasted character if the direction is backup. 

Such cursor positioning affects a subsequent string search.  KS is used in
the definition of the keypad SUBS function so that the character which
follows the pasted text in the current direction is included in the next
string search. 
3 MOVE
The MOVE command moves the cursor a specified number of
entities.
 
Format:		[+|-] [count] [+|-] entity
 
If an explicit sign is used, the direction of the move is determined 
by that sign ( + for forward, - for backward); otherwise, the current
direction mode (set by the ADV and BACK commands) is used to determine
the direction. 
 
Ex:	+3W	Move the cursor 3 words forward
 
	L     	Move the cursor 1 line in the current direction
 
	-PAGE	Move the cursor backward to a page mark
3 PASTE
The PASTE command copies the contents of an alternate buffer into
the current buffer at the cursor position.
 
Format:		[count] PASTE [=buffer]
 
If you omit the buffer name, the PASTE buffer is used.
3 QUIT
The QUIT subcommand leaves the editor without saving any text 
buffers.  This will cause you to lose any editing you have done in 
this session unless you used the WRITE command to save the text before
quitting.
 
Format:		QUIT
3 REFRESH
The REFRESH command refreshes the screen.
 
Format:		REF
3 REPLACE
The REPLACE command has the same form as the DELETE command.  In
nokeypad mode, replace will enter insert mode after the text is deleted.
 
Format:		[+|-] [repeat-count] R [+|-] [count] [+|-] entity
3 SELECT
The SELECT command is used to mark a portion of text which will be 
one end of a select range.  A select range is created by marking one 
end of the desired text (either end will do), moving to the other end,
and performing an operation on the SR (select range) entity.
 
Format:		SEL
3 SHIFT
Use the SHIFT LEFT and SHIFT RIGHT commands to alter the left margin
when in change mode.  The left margin is the position of the first
character in each line which will be displayed on the screen.
Normally, the left margin is 0, which means all characters are 
displayed.  If you use a SHR command, the left margin can be changed by 
an integral number of tab stops (8 characters).  If SHL is used once, 
the first 8 columns will not be displayed on the screen.  This has the 
effect of shifting the screen window horizontally.
	 
Format:		count SHL	(Shift left by count tab stops)
 
		count SHR	(Shift right by count tab stops)
3 SUBSTITUTE
The SUBSTITUTE command replaces occurrences of one string of 
characters with another.
	 
Format:		[+|-] [count] S/string-1/string-2/
 
The slashes represent any non-alphanumeric character used to delimit 
the two strings.  The effect of the command is to search in the 
specified direction from the cursor and find an occurrence of string-1.
It is then deleted and string-2 in inserted in its place. 
3 SUBSTITUTE NEXT
The SUBSTITUTE NEXT command performs a SUBSTITUTE command using the
same search and replacement strings as the previous SUBSTITUTE command.
	
Format:		[+|-] [count] SN
3 TAB
Use the TAB subcommand when the structured tab feature is enabled.
Insert the correct number of tabs and blanks to position to the 
current tab level.  When structured tabs have not been enabled or the 
cursor is not at the beginning of a line, this command inserts a tab 
character.
 
Format:		TAB
3 TADJ
The TADJ command adjusts the tab level for the selected range of text.
The tab size and repeat-count set the tab level (see TC).  The tab level
is adjusted by the value of repeat-count; it is incremented for a positive
repeat-count and decremented for a negative repeat-count.  The TADJ tab
setting is the product of the tab size and the indentation level.

Format:		[+|-] [repeat-count] TADJ [+|-] [entity-count] [+|-] entity
3 TC
The TC subcommand is used to compute the tab level from the current 
cursor position.  This command has meaning only if the structured tab 
feature has been enabled.  See the SET TAB command.
 
Format:		TC
3 TD
The TD subcommand decreases the tab level counter.  This command has 
meaning only when the structured tab feature has been enabled.  See 
the SET TAB command.
 
Format:		TD
3 TI
The TI subcommand increases the tab level counter.  This commmand has 
meaning only when the structured tab feature has been enabled.  See 
the SET TAB command.
 
Format:		TI
3 TOP
The TOP command is used to force the line on which the cursor is 
positioned to the top of the screen.  
 
Format:		TOP
3 UNDELETE
The UNDELETE commands are used to restore the last entity deleted
by a delete command.
 
Format:		UNDC  	(undelete character)
		UNDW	(undelete word)
		UNDL	(undelete line)
3 ^
This command provides for the insertion of control characters in text.
EDT accepts a circumflex (^) followed by an alphabetic character and
inserts the corresponding control character in the text as a single
character.

Format:		[count]^[A..Z]
1 COPY
The COPY (abbreviation: CO) command copies text from one location to
another within a buffer or between buffers.  When text is copied,
the source text remains intact.
 
Format: 	COPY [range-1] TO [range-2] [/QUERY] [/DUPLICATE:n]
 
The lines specified by range-1 are copied in front of the first line
specified  by range-2.  Either range defaults to the current line.     
 
If the destination is not the current buffer, put the name of the
receiving  buffer immediately after TO (=buffer). Give the
full name of  the buffer.  To copy text from an external file, see
INCLUDE. 
2 /DUPLICATE
Format: 	/DUPLICATE:n
 
When you use the /DUPLICATE (abbreviation: /DUP) qualifier, the lines
specified by range-1 are duplicated n times. 
2 /QUERY
Format:		/QUERY
 
When you use the /QUERY (abbreviation: /Q) qualifier, EDT prompts you
with a '?' to verify each line to be copied.
 
Responses are:
 
	Y   Yes, copy this line
	N   No, do not copy this line
	Q   Quit, do not copy any of the rest of the lines
	A   All, copy all the rest of the lines
1 DEFINE
The DEFINE command (abbreviation DEF) defines either editing
keys for keypad mode or macros for line mode.
2 KEY
The DEFINE KEY (abbreviation DEF K) command defines customized editing
keypads or extends the keypad now available by using additional
control keys.  
 
Format: 	DEFINE KEY key-selector AS 'string'
 
where key-selector is one of the following:

	[GOLD] number
	[GOLD] CONTROL letter
	 GOLD  character

Number refers to keypad keys and CONTROL letter names specific control keys
(upper and lower case letters are considered equivalent).  Character refers
to any keyboard key except 0-9, !, %, ', and ".  

The string is a string of change mode subcommands which define the function of
the key.  If you want the command to be executed when the key is struck, the
definition must end with a period; otherwise, EDT will buffer it until a key
with a period is used. 
 
You can use a '?' character in key definitions to request input from
the user. The '?' character is then replaced by the characters read
from the terminal before the command is executed.  A prompt string
enclosed in single quotes may follow the '?'.
3 EXAMPLES
To define the key CTRL/A to move 3 lines, use the following command:
 
    DEFINE KEY CONTROL A AS '3L.'
 
To define the keypad GOLD function of the uparrow key to mean "go
to top of file," use the following command: 
 
    DEFINE KEY GOLD 12 AS 'BR.'
 
To define the key CTRL/D to write your COBOL identification division
header for you, enter the following command: 
  
    DEFINE KEY CONTROL D AS 'iIDENTIFICATION DIVISION.^Z^MiPROGRAM-ID. ?^Z.'
 
(After pressing the key, you will have to give the program name.)
 
To define the CTRL/R  key to prompt for the name of a BLISS
routine which it will then find, use the following commmand:
 
    DEFINE KEY CONTROL R AS "BR ADV 'ROUTINE ?'Routine name: ''."

2 MACRO
The DEFINE MACRO (abbreviation DEF M) command is used to define line
mode macro commands.
 
Format:		DEFINE MACRO name
 
The name is the name of the text buffer in which the macro is stored.
The macro itself is a series of EDT commands.
 
Invoke the macro by giving its name in response to the line mode
prompt.
1 DELETE
The DELETE (abbreviation: D) command deletes the lines specified by
the range.  
 
Format:		DELETE [range] [/QUERY]
 
If you do not specify the range, the default is the current line.
2 /QUERY
Format:		/QUERY
 
When the /QUERY (abbreviation: /Q) qualifier is used, the user is
prompted with a '?' to verify each line to be deleted.
 
Responses are:
 
	Y   Yes, delete this line
	N   No, do not delete this line
	Q   Quit, do not delete any of the rest of the lines
	A   All, delete all the rest of the lines
1 EXIT
The EXIT (abbreviation: EX) command terminates all action in the
editor and saves a copy of the MAIN text buffer in the output file.
 
Format:		EXIT [file-spec] [/SEQUENCE:[init:incr]] [/SAVE]
 
If you omit the file specification, the output file name from the
command line which invoked EDT is used. 
2 /SAVE
When you use the SAVE qualifier, the journal file is saved. The
journal file is called name.JOU where name is the output file name
from the command line.  For information about the journal facility,
see HELP JOURNAL. 
2 /SEQUENCE
Format:		/SEQUENCE[:init:incr]

When you use the SEQUENCE option, the output file is in VFC
(variable with fixed control) format, and line numbers are
written in the control field.

If you set init and incr, the file is renumbered starting with the
number you choose for init and the lines are incremented by the
number you choose for incr.  Otherwise, the original line numbers
are written and new lines will be numbered 0.
1 FILL
The FILL (abbreviation: FIL) command reformats a block of  text so
that there are as many full words on a line as possible  without
exceeding the right margin. 
 
Format:		FILL	[range]
 
The lines in the range must be contiguous.  If you omit the range,
the select range is assumed.
 
The right margin is set by the SET WRAP command.  If the margin has
not been set, the default is the terminal width minus 1. 
1 FIND
The FIND (abbreviation: F) command places the cursor at the first line
specified by range.  
 
Format:		FIND [range]
 
The located line is not typed. To find and type a line, use the TYPE
command. 
1 INCLUDE
The INCLUDE (abbreviation: INC) command copies external files into
text buffers.  
 
Format:		INCLUDE file-spec [range]
 
The specified file is copied to the location before the first line of
the range.  Note that range specifies the position to which the file 
will be copied; it does not restrict the portion of the file which 
will be included.
1 INSERT
The INSERT (abbreviation: I) command inserts new text into a
text  buffer. 
  
Format:		INSERT [range] [;line to be inserted]
  
The new text is inserted before the first line specified by range.  If
you omit range, inserted text is placed just before the line at which
the cursor is located.  
  
If you do not use the optional semicolon, the editor enters insert
mode. In insert mode, you can enter as many lines of text as you wish, 
terminating each line with a carriage return.  You terminate insert 
mode by typing CTRL/Z. 
 
If you choose the optional semicolon, the text on the line 
following the semicolon is inserted and the editor does not enter 
insert mode.
 
The line following the last line inserted becomes the current line.
1 JOURNAL
EDT saves all input from the terminal during an editing
session in a file called the journal file.   The
journal file is deleted when you exit the editor with an EXIT command
or a QUIT command (without the /SAVE option). When the editor is left
involuntarily, the journal file is saved.  
 
The journal file can be used to redo all the operations of an editing 
session. The edited file is thereby recreated.  Type the same command
line used previously with the addition of the /RECOVER qualifier.
 
Unless explicitly overridden by the JOURNAL qualifier on the command
line, the journal file will have the same name as the output file,
except that the file type will be JOU.
1 MOVE
The MOVE (abbreviation: M) command moves text from one location to
another, deleting it from the original location.
 
Format:		MOVE [range-1] TO [range-2] [/QUERY]
 
The lines specified by range-1 are moved to a location immediately 
before the first line specified by range-2.  The lines are deleted 
from the original location.  If you omit either of the range specifications,
the current line is used.  The first line of range-2 becomes
the new current line.  To move lines of text without deleting them
from  the original location, see the COPY command. 
2 /QUERY
Format:		/QUERY
 
When you use the QUERY (abbreviation: /Q) qualifier, EDT prompts you
is with a '?' to verify each line to be moved. 
 
Responses are:
 
	Y   Yes, move this line.
	N   No, do not move this line.
	Q   Quit, do not move any of the rest of the lines.
	A   All, move all the rest of the lines.
1 PRINT
The PRINT (abbreviation: P) command creates a listing file with the
specified file name. 
 
Format:		PRINT file-spec [range]
 
The lines selected by range are written to a listing format file with
page headers.  If the NUMBERS option is set (see SET NUMBERS), the EDT
line numbers will appear on the listing.  If you omit range, the
entire current buffer is printed.  The current line is not altered by
this command.  Use PRINT only to create a listing;  if you
wish to create a file, use the WRITE command. 
1 QUIT
The QUIT command exits the editor without saving the contents of the
MAIN buffer. 
 
Format:		QUIT [/SAVE]
 
Use the QUIT command only if you have made no changes to 
the file you are editing or if you have decided you do not wish to 
make the changes you have made.  All edits to the file will be lost 
when you QUIT from the editor.
2 /SAVE
The SAVE qualifier specifies that the journal file should be saved.
Normally, the journal file is deleted when you QUIT.
1 REPLACE
The REPLACE (abbreviation: R) command deletes the specified range of
lines and then places EDT in the INSERT mode. 
 
The REPLACE command has the following form:
 
	REPLACE [range] [;text to insert]
 
When you do not specify a range, the current line is deleted and the new
text is inserted at that location.  
 
If you do not use the optional semicolon, the editor enters insert mode.
In insert mode you can enter as many lines of text as you wish, 
terminating each line with a carriage return.  You terminate insert 
mode by typing CTRL/Z. 
 
If you use the optional semicolon, EDT inserts the text in the command line 
following the semicolon and the editor does not enter insert mode.
 
The line following the last line inserted becomes the current line.
1 RESEQUENCE
The RESEQUENCE (abbreviation: RES) command assigns new line numbers
to a range of lines.  
 
Format:		RESEQUENCE [range] [/SEQUENCE:init:incr]
 
The specified range of lines must be contiguous. When you do not specify
a range, all lines in the  current buffer are resequenced.  If the
new numbers assigned would cause duplicate or nonsequential line
numbers, EDT will either disallow the command or  renumber lines
beyond the specified range. 
2 /SEQUENCE
The SEQUENCE (abbreviation: /SEQ) qualifier specifies the 
sequence of numbers to be assigned.  The init parameter specifies 
the initial number, and incr specifies the number by which the lines
are incremented.  If you do not use the SEQUENCE qualifier, init 
and incr both default to 1.
1 RANGE
Range specifications are used on most line editing commands to select
the exact lines of text on which the command will operate. 
 
There are several general classes of range specifications:
 
	1.  Single line ranges specify a single line of text.
 
	2.  Multiple line ranges specify blocks of text, such as an
	    entire buffer or all lines from the current line to the 
	    end of the buffer.
	
	3.  Compound ranges combine single line ranges with operators 
	    to specify multiple lines of text.

	4.  Noncontiguous ranges specify multiple lines that are not
	    necessarily adjacent to one another.
2 ALL
The ALL range further refines a general range specification.

Format:		[range] ALL 'string'

While range can be a single, multiple, or compound range, the command
being performed will only apply to those lines of text containing the
given string.  This string can be enclosed in single or double quotes.

Ex:	TYPE ALL 'EDT'		When ALL is used, the default for range
				is WHOLE.  This command will type all the
				lines in the current buffer containing EDT.

	SUBS/A/B/50:100 ALL '1'	Substitute B for A in lines from 50 to 100
				which include the string 1.
2 AND
The AND range selects a group of single lines.
 
Format:		range-1 AND range-2 AND range3 ...    or
		range-1 , range-2 , range3
 
Each of the ranges must be a single line range.  Each of the single 
lines is operated on.
 
Ex:	TYPE 4 AND 7 		Lines 4 and 7 are displayed on the terminal
 
	TYPE BEGIN,END-1	The first and last lines are displayed on
				the terminal
2 BEGIN
The BEGIN range (abbreviation: B) is a single line range which 
specifies the first line in the buffer.
2 BEFORE
The BEFORE range (abbreviation: BEF) is a multiple line range which 
specifies all the lines in the buffer preceding the current line.
2 BUFFER
The BUFFER (abbreviation: BU) specification may precede any other range
specification and indicates that the range is to be applied to a named
buffer.  
 
 
Format:		BUFFER name [range]     or
		=name [range]
 
The two forms are equivalent.  Name is the name of the buffer in which 
the text resides.  If you leave out the range, the entire buffer is
selected.
2 DOT
The dot (.) is a single line range which refers to the current line of 
text.  For many commands, dot is the default range.  See the help text 
for a command if you are unsure of the default.
	
Ex:	TYPE . 		Type the current line.
2 END
The END (abbreviation: E) range specifies an imaginary line following 
the last line in the buffer.  END does NOT specify the last line in 
the buffer.  The last line can be referred to by E-1 (that is, the line
preceding END).  When the END line is typed, it looks like:
 
[EOB]
2 FOR
The FOR range is a multiple line range which selects a 
specified number of lines starting at a specified location.
 
Format:		[range] FOR n   or
		[range] # n
 
The two forms are equivalent.  Range is a single line range which 
specifies the starting position, and n is an integer number.  If range 
is omitted, the current line is the starting position.
 
Ex:	TYPE	. FOR 5		Type 5 lines, starting with the current
				line
 
	TYPE	#5		Equivalent to the previous example
 
	TYPE	BEGIN FOR 10	Type the first 10 lines in the buffer
2 LAST
The LAST (abbreviation: L) range is a single line range which refers to 
the line in a previous buffer which was the current line when you
switched to the current buffer.
2 MINUS
The minus sign in ranges selects a single line which is a
specified  number of lines before a specified line. 
 
Format:		[range] - [n]
 
Range is a single line range, and n is an integer.  The line selected
is the line which is n lines before the line specified by range.  If 
you omit range, the current line is used; if you omit n, 1 is used.
 
Ex:	TYPE 15 - 3	Type the third line before the line numbered 15.
 
	TYPE END -1	Type the last line in the buffer.
 
	TYPE  -		Type the previous line.
2 NUMBER
A line number is a single line range which refers to the line having 
the specified number.  The line number may contain a decimal point.
 
Ex:	TYPE 10		Type line number 10.
 
	INSERT 65.3	Insert before line 65.3.
2 ORIGINAL
Format:	 ORIGINAL n
 
The ORIGINAL (abbreviation: O) range is a single line range which 
refers to the line which had the original number n.  The original 
number is one of the following: 
 
	1.  If the line came from the primary input file and that file
	    had sequence numbers, then the original number is the 
	    sequence number read from the file.
 
	2.  If the line came from an unsequenced input file, then it
	    is the number originally assigned by EDT, which does not
	    change when a resequence is done.
 
	3.  If the line did not come from the primary input file, then 
	    its original number is zero.
2 PLUS
The plus sign is used in ranges to select a single line which is a
specified  number of lines after a specified line. 
 
Format:		[range] + [n]
 
Range is a single line range, and n is an integer.  The line selected
is the line which is n lines after the line specified by range.  If you 
omit range, the current line is used.  If you omit n, 1 is used.
 
Ex:	T 15 + 3	Type the third line after the line numbered 15.
 
	T BEGIN +1	Type the second line in the buffer.
 
	T +		Type the line following the current line.
 
	T 'string'+2	Type the second line following the next line 
			containing 'string'.
2 REST
The REST (abbreviation: R) range is a multiple line range which refers 
to the current line and all lines following in the buffer.
2 SELECT
The SELECT range is a multiple line range which contains all lines 
between the current line and the SELECT mark.  The SELECT mark is set 
by the change mode SEL subcommand.
2 STRING
A quoted string specifies a single line which contains the  specified
string.  The string can be enclosed in either single or double quotes
(' or ").  When you use a string as a range, EDT will search forward,
starting with the current line, until it locates a line with the specified
string.  If a minus sign (-) precedes the string, the search will
be backward.
 
Ex:	T 'abc'		Locate and type the first line forward which 
			contains the string 'abc'
 
	T -"abc"	Same, except the search will be backward.
2 THRU
The THRU range is a compound range which specifies all lines between
two single line ranges.
 
Format:		range-1 THRU range-2 	or
		range-1 : range-2
 
Both forms are equivalent.  Starting with range-1, EDT selects all the
lines up to and including the line specified by range-2.
 
Ex:	TYP 15:30		Type all lines with numbers between 
				15 and 30.
 
	TYP 'glorp':END		Type all lines from the first line 
				forward containing 'glorp' to the end.
2 WHOLE
The WHOLE (abbreviation: W) range refers to the entire text buffer.
1 SET
The SET (abbreviation: SE) command sets options that control other
editor operations. Once set, these options are in effect throughout the
rest of the edit session or until changed by the SET command.  
2 CASE
Format:	   	SET CASE { UPPER | LOWER | NONE }
 
Use the SET CASE (abbreviation: SE CA) command on terminals which are
capable of displaying upper case characters only.  SET CASE instructs
EDT to flag with a preceding apostrophe either the upper case characters,
the lower case characters, or neither.  The default for SET CASE is
NONE, which means no characters are flagged.
 
The keywords can be abbreviated as follows:
 
	CASE 	CA
	UPPER	U
	LOWER	L
	NONE	N
2 CURSOR
Format:		 SET CURSOR top:bottom 
 
The SET CURSOR (abbreviation: SE CU) command, used with screen editing,
sets the limits within which the cursor is allowed to move without
scrolling the screen.
 
Top and bottom are the line numbers at the top of the screen and  the
bottom of the screen.  The line numbers must be in the range of 0 to 21,
with 0 specifying the top of the screen and 21 the bottom.  The
default  setting is 7:14, allowing the cursor to move within the
middle third of  the screen.  
2 ENTITY
Format:		SET ENTITY   entity-type 'delimiter string'
 
Entity-type is one of the following:
 
	WORD		(abbreviation: W)
	SENTENCE	(abbreviation: S)
	PAGE		(abbreviation: PAG)
	PARAGRAPH	(abbreviation: PAR)
 
The SET ENTITY (abbreviation: SE EN) command sets the 
delimiters for the user-defined change mode entities.  For the 
WORD and SENTENCE entities, the delimiter string is a set of single 
character delimiters.  For PAGE and PARAGRAPH, the delimiter is a
character string which delimits the entity.  See HELP CHANGE
ENTITIES for explanations of the entities.
2 KEYPAD
Format:		SET [NO]KEYPAD
 
The SET KEYPAD (abbreviation: SE K) option controls whether or not the 
editing keypad is to be used when you are in CHANGE mode.  KEYPAD is set by 
default for VT52 and VT100 terminals, which means the alternate keypad
is used to enter change mode commands.  If you prefer the change mode
compatible with EDT version 1, use the SET NOKEYPAD command.
2 LINES
The SET LINES (abbreviation: SE L) command controls the number of 
screen lines used in either of the screen versions of change mode.  
Use this option to reduce the time it takes to refresh the
screen image when editing at low baud rates.
 
Format:		SET LINES n
 
where n is the number of lines to use.  n must be between 1 and 22.
By default, n is set to 22 lines.
2 MODE
The SET MODE (abbreviation: SE M) command determines which 
mode of editing should be entered after all initial processing is 
complete.  This command is useful only in the startup command file.
 
Format:		SET MODE { LINE | CHANGE }
 
By default, EDT enters line mode when the startup processing is 
complete.  Use SET MODE CHANGE in your startup file to cause EDT to
enter change mode immediately.
2 NUMBERS
Format:		SET [NO]NUMBERS
 
The SET NUMBERS (abbreviation: SE NU) command controls the typing of
line numbers on the terminal.  Numbers is set on by default.
If you want to suppress numbers, use SET NONUMBERS (abbreviation: NON).
2 QUIET
The SET QUIET (abbreviation: SE Q) command controls whether or not the 
bell will sound when an error is made in change mode.
	
Format:		SET [NO]QUIET
	
The quiet option is off (meaning the bell will sound) by default.
2 SEARCH
The SET SEARCH (abbreviation: SE SE) command controls 
several options related to string searching.
 
Format:		SET SEARCH	{ GENERAL | EXACT }
				{ [UN]BOUNDED }
				{ BEGIN | END }
 
The GENERAL (abbreviation: G) / EXACT (abbreviation: EX) option 
controls whether or not the case of alphabetic characters must be the
same as those in the search string to match.  The default is GENERAL,
which means that case is ignored in string searches.     
 
The BOUNDED (abbreviation: BO) option defines whether or not the search
is bounded by a page delimiter.  By default, the search is unbounded, 
which means that the entire buffer will be searched.  This option has 
effect only in change mode.
 
The BEGIN (abbreviation: B) / END (abbreviation: E) option determines 
whether the cursor is left at the beginning or end of the search 
string when it is found.  By default, the cursor is left at the 
beginning.  This option has effect only in change mode. 
2 SCREEN
The SET SCREEN (abbreviation: SE SC) command controls the 
number of characters displayed on a line.
 
Format:		SET SCREEN w
 
where w is the width of the screen line.  By default, the screen width
is set to 80 characters.
2 TAB
The SET TAB (abbreviation: SE TA) command enables the 
structured tab feature and sets the logical tab size.
 
Format:		SET [NO]TAB n
 
where n is the number of columns in a logical tab stop.
 
With the structured tab feature, EDT keeps a counter of 
the tab level, which is set to 1 when the SET TAB command is issued.
When you use the tab key in change mode at the beginning of a line, 
EDT will insert enough tabs and spaces to move the cursor to the column 
defined by the level n times the tab size.  There are change mode
subcommands to alter the tab level.  The structured tab feature is
disabled by default. 
 
The tab size set by the tab command is also used by the TABS ADJUST
command.
2 TERMINAL
Format:		SET TERMINAL { HCPY | VT52 | VT100 }
 
The SET TERMINAL (abbreviation: SE TE) command identifies to EDT 
the type of terminal you are using.  Normally, EDT will set the 
terminal type by asking the operating system what type it is.  If it
does not appear to have set the type correctly, you can use the SHOW
TERMINAL command to see what EDT thinks your terminal is and the SET
TERMINAL command to correct it if necessary.  If your terminal is not
a VT52 or a VT100, it should be set to HCPY (hardcopy).
2 TRUNCATE
The SET TRUNCATE (abbreviatin: SE TR) command controls the 
handling of long lines in change mode.
 
Format:		SET [NO]TRUNCATE
 
By default, truncate mode is set, which means long lines will be 
truncated on the display (the actual text is not altered).  If you turn
off truncate mode by using SET NOTRUNCATE, long lines will
be wrapped to as many screen lines as are necessary to display the
entire line. 
2 VERIFY
The SET VERIFY (abbreviation: SE V) command controls the
listing of commands which are executed from the startup file or from a
macro.
 
Format:		SET [NO]VERIFY
 
Verify is off by default, which means the lines are not typed.  If you
turn it on, each command line is typed as it is executed.
2 WRAP
Format:		SET [NO]WRAP n

The SET WRAP (abbreviation: SE W) command enables word wrapping and
specifies the right margin.  Word wrapping is a mode in which EDT
will automatically insert carriage returns when you are typing in
new text and the line exceeds a right margin.  Word wrapping is in
effect in change mode only and only if you have used the SET WRAP
command.  
 
The SET WRAP command is also used to set the right margin for the 
change mode FILL subcommmand.

SET NOWRAP (abbreviation: SE NOW) disables the word wrapping feature.
1 SHOW
Format:		SHOW parameter
 
The SHOW (abbreviation: SH BU) command displays selected information on
the current state of the editor.  Parameter is one of the additional
topics listed below.
2 BUFFER
Format:		SHOW BUFFER
 
The SHOW BUFFER (abbreviation: SH BU) command lists the buffers being used
during the edit session, including the number of lines of text in each
buffer. The current  buffer is marked by an  equal sign (=) before
the name.  If an asterisk follows the number of lines, it indicates
that an input  file is connected to the buffer and that there are
more lines to be read from the file.  Thus, the line count is not
accurate.  
2 CASE
Format:		SHOW CASE

The SHOW CASE (abbreviation: SH CA) command shows the current case
setting (upper, lower, or none).
2 CURSOR
Format:		SHOW CURSOR
 
The SHOW CURSOR (abbreviation: SH CU) command shows the
current setting of the cursor region.  EDT will respond with:
 
t:b
 
where t and b are integer numbers indicating the top and bottom of
the cursor region.  See HELP SET CURSOR for an explanation of the 
cursor region.
2 ENTITY
Format:		SHOW ENTITY entity-type
 
where entity type is one of the following: 
 
	WORD		(abbreviation: W)
	SENTENCE	(abbreviation: S)
	PAGE		(abbreviation: PAG)
	PARAGRAPH	(abbreviation: PAR)
 
The SHOW ENTITY (abbreviation: SH EN) command displays the current
delimiter string for the specified entity.
2 KEY
Format:		SHOW KEY key-selector
 
where key-selector is one of the following:
 
	[GOLD] number
	[GOLD] CONTROL letter
	 GOLD  character
 
The SHOW KEY (abbreviation: SH K) command displays the 
current definition of a keypad or control key.  See HELP DEFINE KEY.
2 SCREEN
Format:		SHOW SCREEN

The SHOW SCREEN (abbreviation: SH SC) command shows the current setting
for the maximum length of a line EDT displays.
2 SEARCH
Format:		SHOW SEARCH

The SHOW SEARCH (abbreviation: SH SE) command shows the current search
parameters.  See HELP SET SEARCH for a description of search options.
2 TERMINAL
Format:		SHOW TERMINAL

The SHOW TERMINAL (abbreviation: SH TE) command shows your terminal
type (VT52, VT100, or Hardcopy).
2 VERSION
Format:		SHOW VERSION
 
The SHOW VERSION (abbreviation: SH VE) command displays the 
version number of the editor. 
1 SUBSTITUTE
The SUBSTITUTE (abbreviation: S) command replaces occurrences of one 
string of characters with another string.
 
Format:		SUBSTITUTE/string-1/string-2/ [range] [/BRIEF[:n]]
		[/QUERY] [/NOTYPE]
 
Any nonalphanumeric character can be used as string delimiters.
 
All occurrences of string-1 within the specified range are replaced 
with string-2.  If you do not specify range, a single occurrence in the
current line is substituted.  The line in which the substitution
occurred is typed after each substitution.
2 /BRIEF[:n]
When you select the BRIEF (abbreviation: /BR) option, only the first
n characters of the line are displayed.  If you omit n, the default
is 10.
2 /NOTYPE
When you specify /NOTYPE (abbreviation: /NOT) the lines in which
substitutions occurred are not typed.  
2 NEXT
The SUBSTITUTE NEXT (abbreviation: N) command replaces the next
occurrence of string-1 with string-2. 
 
The SUBSTITUTE NEXT command has the following form:
 
	[SUBSTITUTE] NEXT [/string-1/string-2/]
 
The search for string-1 is made forward from the current location.
When a substitution is made, the line where the substitution occurs 
becomes the current line.
 
When the optional strings are omitted, the strings used in the 
last SUBSTITUTE or SUBSTITUTE NEXT command are used. 
2 /QUERY
Format:		/QUERY
 
When you use the QUERY (abbreviation: /Q) qualifier, EDT prompts you
with a '?' to verify each substitution.
 
Responses are:
 
	Y   Yes, do the substitution.
	N   No, do not do the substitution.
	Q   Quit, terminate the command.
	A   All, do the rest of the substitutions without query.
1 TABS
The TAB ADJUST (abbreviation: TA A) command shifts each of
a range of lines a specified number of logical tab stops.
 
Format:		TAB ADJUST [-] n [range]
 
where n is the number of tab stops to shift.  You must use the SET TAB
command to set the logical tab size in order for this command  to
work.  If you omit range, the select range is assumed.  If a minus sign 
precedes the count n, the text shifts to the left.  Otherwise, it
shifts to the right. 
1 TYPE
The TYPE (abbreviation: T) command displays the specified range of
lines on the terminal.   
 
Format:		TYPE [range] [/BRIEF[:n]] [/STAY]
 
The first line in the specified range becomes the current line.
 
If the range specification starts with a non-alphabetic character, the
keyword TYPE may be omitted completely. 
2 /BRIEF
Format:		/BRIEF[:n]
 
When you select the BRIEF (abbreviation: /BR) option, only the
first n characters of the  line are displayed.  If you omit n, the
default is 10.
2 /STAY
Format:		/STAY
 
When you select the STAY (abbreviation: /ST) option, the cursor
position is not changed by the TYPE command.  This enables you to
look at text elsewhere in the buffer (or in another buffer) without
losing your position.
1 WRITE
The WRITE (abbreviation: WR) command creates a file from a specified
range of lines.
 
Format:		WRITE file-spec [range] [/SEQUENCE[:init:incr]]
 
When you specify a range, the text contained in that range becomes the
file.  When you do not specify a range, the contents of the current text
buffer becomes the new file.  The cursor position is not affected by
the WRITE command.  If the file-spec and range are omitted, then the
entire buffer is written to the output file. 
2 /SEQUENCE 
Format: 	/SEQUENCE[:init:incr]
 
When you use the SEQUENCE option, the output file is in VFC
(variable with fixed control) format, and line numbers are written
in the control field. 
 
If you set init and incr, the file is renumbered starting with the
number you choose for initial and the lines are incremented by the
number you choose for incr.  Otherwise, the original line numbers
are written and new lines will be numbered 0.

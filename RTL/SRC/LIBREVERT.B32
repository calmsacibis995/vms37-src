! ABSTRACT:
!
!	LIB$REVERT deletes the handler associated with
!	the procedure activation of the caller.  This is done
!	by clearing the handler address in the stack frame 
!	of the caller.  The handler address which had been
!	associated with the caller is returned as the value.
!
! ENVIRONMENT:	User mode, re-entrant, AST level or not or mixed.

; The COBOL compiler allocates twelve bytes for an intermediate
; temporary value, which are arranged as follows: 
;
;	+--------------+
;	| INT$W_I_EXP  |	: Intermediate temp
;	+--------------+
;	| INT$P_I_FRACT|
;	|              |
;	|              |
;	|              |
;	+--------------+
;
; The fraction is a packed, 18-digit number.  The fraction is normalized
; with the high-order digit non-zero (unless the whole number is zero).
; The exponent is kept in true form.  If the exponent is -32768, the
; number is the reserved operand.  Otherwise the exponent must be in the
; range from +99 to -99 decimal.
;
; Define the symbols which are used to access and manipulate the
; intermediate data type.

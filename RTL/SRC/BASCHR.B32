! FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION:
!
!	Return unsigned byte integer \should this be signed, error if neg\
!	as a one byte 8-bit ASCII string according to the semantics of the
!	destination string.  Range of input byte is 0 through 255.
!	Since output string is first argument, this can be called as either
!	a subroutine of two arguments, or a string function of one argument.
!
! FORMAL PARAMETERS:
!
!	DEST_DESC.wt.dx		pointer to destination string descriptor
!	INTEGER.rbu.v		value of ASCII integer
!
! IMPLICIT INPUTS:
!
!	NONE
!
! IMPLICIT OUTPUTS:
!
!	NONE
!
! ROUTINE VALUES:
! COMPLETION CODES:
!
!	NONE
!
! SIDE EFFECTS:
!
!	This routine JSBs to STR$COPY$R_R8 and therefore may signal any
!	of its errors or return any of its statuses.  It may also
!	allocate or deallocate space for the destination string, and
!	lock that string from being written for a period of time.

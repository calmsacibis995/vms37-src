! ABSTRACT:
!
!	This module extracts a substring according to the
!	BASIC-PLUS-2 syntax.  It finds the substring of a main string
!	starting at the left end of the string (character position 1)
!	and continues through the nth character of the string.  This
!	substring is copied to the destination string.
!
! ENVIRONMENT: User mode, AST level or not or mixed

! FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION:
!
!	This routine extracts the characters starting at the leftmost
!	character (character position 1) and continuing through the
!	character position specified by the input and copies that substring
!	to the destination string (by JSB to STR$$COPY_R_R8) according
!	to the syntax of the class of the destination string.
!	If the input character position is > the length of the input string,
!	then the length of the input string is used.  If the input character
!	position is < 1, the destination becomes a null string.
!
! FORMAL PARAMETERS:
!
!	DEST_DESC.wt.dx		pointer to destination string descriptor
!	SRC_DESC.rt.dx		pointer to source string descriptor
!	CHAR_POS.rw.v		value of last character position to include

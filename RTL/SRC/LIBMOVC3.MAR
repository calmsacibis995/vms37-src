;++
; FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION:
;
;	LIB$MOVC3 makes the VAX MOVC3 instruction available as
;	a callable procedure.
;
;	The source is moved to the destination.  The operation is
;	such that overlap of the source and destination does not
;	affect the result.
;
;	For more information, see the VAX-11 Architecture Handbook.
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;
;	status.wlc.v = LIB$MOVC3 (length.rwu.r, source.rz.r, dest.wz.r)
;
; FORMAL PARAMETERS:
;
	length	= 4		; The number of bytes to move from source
				; to dest.  Passed by reference.  The maximum
				; value is 65535.

	source	= 8		; The source to move from.  Passed by reference.

	dest	= 12		; The destination to move to.  Passed by
				; reference.

;
; IMPLICIT INPUTS:
;
;	NONE
;
; IMPLICIT OUTPUTS:
;
;	NONE
;
; COMPLETION STATUS:
;
;	SS$_NORMAL	Procedure successfully completed.
;
; SIDE EFFECTS:
;
;	NONE

	MOVL	#1, R0			; SS$_NORMAL

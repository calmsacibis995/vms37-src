GLOBAL ROUTINE ERRTST (	! FORTRAN compatibility test error info
	FORT_ERR_NO,	! Adr. of word containing error number
	OCCURRED)		! Adr. of word to receive 1 (occurred) or 2 (has not occurred)
	:NOVALUE =		! No value is returned

!++
! FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION:
!
!	The ERRTST subroutine tests for the occurrence of a specific
!	error during program execution.  FORT_ERR_NO specifies
!	the FORTRAN error number and OCCURRED receives:
!		1 if error number FORT_ERR_NO has occurred.
!		2 if error number FORT_ERR_NO has not occurred
!
!	since the last CALL ERRTST for that error number.
!	Thus the ERRTST subroutine resets the error flag for that
!	error.  All error flags are initially 0 when the image is started up.
!
! FORMAL PARAMETERS:
!
!	FORT_ERR_NO.rw.r	Adr. of word containing FORTRAN error number
!	OCCURRED.ww.r		Adr. of word to received 1 or 2.
!
! IMPLICIT INPUTS:
!
!	COM$$ERR_TAB byte table indexed by FORTRAN error number.
!
! IMPLICIT OUTPUTS:
!
!	COM$$ERR_TAB byte table.  Occurred flag is cleared for specified error number.
!
! COMPLETION CODES:
!
!	NONE
!
! SIDE EFFECTS:
!
!	Clears occurred bit in EXTERNAL COM$$ERR_TAB for specified
!	FORTRAN error number.

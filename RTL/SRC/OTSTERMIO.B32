! ABSTRACT:
!
!	This module contains a routine which tests the currently
!	outstanding I/O, and reports whether it is to a terminal.
!	This function is used by BASIC error processing, since
!	some I/O errors are processed differently if the I/O device
!	is a terminal.
!
! ENVIRONMENT:  VAX-11 User Mode

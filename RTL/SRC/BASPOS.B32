! FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION: This routine takes two source strings of any
!	dtype and class and finds the position of the substring in the
!	source string starting at the input starting position.  The routine
!	returns the position of the substring in the source string.
!
! FORMAL PARAMETERS:
!
!	SRC_DESC.rt.dx		pointer to descriptor of string to be searched
!	SUB_DESC.rt.dx		pointer to descriptor of string to find
!	START_POS.rl.v		value of position in source to begin search

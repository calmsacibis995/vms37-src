;++
; FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION:
;
;	LIB$MOVC5 makes the VAX MOVC5 instruction available as
;	a callable procedure.
;
;	The source is moved to the destination.  If the destination is
;	longer than the source, the highest address bytes of the
;	destination are replaced by the fill argument.  If the
;	destination is shorter than the source, the highest
;	addressed bytes of the source are not moved.  The operation is
;	such that overlap of the source and destination does not
;	affect the result.
;
;	For more information, see the VAX-11 Architecture Handbook.
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;
;	status.wlc.v = LIB$MOVC5 (src_len.rwu.r, source.rz.r, fill.rb.r,
;				  dst_len.rwu.r, dest.wz.r)
;
; FORMAL PARAMETERS:
;
	src_len	= 4		; The length of source in bytes.  Passed
				; by reference.  The maximum length is 65535.

	source	= 8		; The source to move from.  Passed by reference.

	fill	= 12		; The fill character.  Passed by reference.

	dst_len	= 16		; The length of dest in bytes.  Passed by
				; reference.  The maximum length is 65535.

	dest	= 20		; The destination to move to.  Passed by
				; reference.

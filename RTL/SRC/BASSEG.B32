! ABSTRACT:
!
!	This module extracts a substring according to the BASIC-PLUS-2
!	syntax.  It finds the substring of a main string starting at the
!	character position specified by the second input parameter and
!	continues for the number of characters specified by the third
!	input parameter.  This substring is copied to the destination string.
!
! ENVIRONMENT: User mode, AST level or not or mixed

GLOBAL ROUTINE BAS$SEG (DEST_DESC, 		! Pointer to destination descriptor

	START_POS, 				! First character to be included
	END_POS) : NOVALUE =			! Last character position to include

!++
! FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION:
!
!	This routine extracts the characters starting at the
!	character position in the source string specified by the 3rd input
!	parameter and continuing to the character position in the source
!	string specified by the 4th input parameter, and copies that substring
!	to the destination string (by JSB to STR$$COPY_R_R8) according
!	to the syntax of the class of the destination string.
!	If the starting position is < 1, 1 is used.  If the ending position is
!	> length of the source string, the length of the source string is
!	used.  If the starting position > the ending position, a null string
!	is returned.
!
! FORMAL PARAMETERS:
!
!	DEST_DESC.wt.dx		pointer to destination string descriptor
!	SRC_DESC.rt.dx		pointer to source string descriptor
!	START_POS.rw.v		character position in src to start substring
!	END_POS.rw.v		character position in src to end substring

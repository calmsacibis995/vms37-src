! 1-007 - Redirect copy call from STR$COPY_R to LIB$SCOPY_R_DX6.  This
!	  eliminates the need for a handler and the need to change
!	  STR$ statuses to LIB$ statuses.

!++
! FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION:
!
!	Return unsigned byte integer (FORTRAN INTEGER*1) as a
!	one-character 8 bit ASCII string.  The range of the input
!	integer is 0 to 255.  Since the output string is the first
!	argument, this can be considered as either a subroutine with
!	two parameters or a string function with one.
!
! FORMAL PARAMETERS:
!
!	RESULT_STR.wt.dx	Address of the descriptor into which
!				the one-character string is written.
!	BYTE_INTEGER.rbu.r	The byte to put in that string.
!
! IMPLICIT INPUTS:
!
!	NONE
!
! IMPLICIT OUTPUTS:
!
!	NONE
!
! COMPLETION CODES:
!
!	SS$_NORMAL	Procedure successfully completed
!	LIB$_STRTRU	Success, but source string truncated
!	LIB$_INSVIRMEM	Insufficient virtual memory
!	LIB$_INVSTRDES	Invalid string descriptor
!	LIB$_FATERRLIB	Fatal error in library
!
! SIDE EFFECTS:
!
!	May allocate a little space for the result string.

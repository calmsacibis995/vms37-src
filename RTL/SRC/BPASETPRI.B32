GLOBAL ROUTINE bpa$set_pri (firqb) : NOVALUE = 	! Change job priority

!++
! FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION:
!
!	If change-indicator in firqb isn't set, then return is made. Otherwise
!	the process identification is fetched and the new priority is set.
!	The input priority (RSTS-priority) is converted to VAX-priority in
!	the following way :
!	Only the last 5 bits of the RSTS priority is used which is equivalent
!	of a division by 8. 16 is added to this value which gives priorities
!	in the range of 0 through 31.
!
! FORMAL PARAMETERS:
!
!	firqb = firqb-address
!
! IMPLICIT INPUTS:
!
!	firqb [fqb$b_pri_ind]	:	nonzero (indicates change of priority)
!	firqb [fqb$v_priority]	:	new priority
!
! IMPLICIT OUTPUTS:
!
!	NONE
!
! ROUTINE VALUE:
!
!	NONE
!
! SIDE EFFECTS:
!
!	NONE

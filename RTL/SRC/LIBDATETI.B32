! ABSTRACT:
!
!	This module contains a routine that returns the date and time
!	in VAX/VMS format in a user-provided string.
!
! ENVIRONMENT:  VAX-11 User Mode

! AUTHOR: John Sauter, CREATION DATE: 16-FEB-1979
!
! MODIFIED BY:
!
! 1-001	- Original.  JBS 16-FEB-1979
! 1-002	- Change LIB$S and OTS$S to STR$.  JBS 21-MAY-1979
! 1-003	- Change call to STR$COPY.  JBS 16-JUL-1979
! 1-004	- Correct an error in a comment.  JBS 30-JUL-1979
! 1-005	- Change STR$ return codes to LIB$ return codes.  
!	  JBS 22-JAN-1980
! 1-006 - Change call from STR$COPY_DX  to LIB$SCOPY_DXDX6.
!	  This eliminates the need for a handler and the need to
!	  change STR$ statuses to LIB$ statuses.
!	  RKR 27-MAY-1981.
! 1-007 - Change name of required file from 'STRLNK.REQ' to
!	  'RTLIN:STRLNK' as it should be.  RKR 31-AUG-1981
! 1-008 - Change to do copying with LIB$SCOPY_R_DX6. RKR 18-NOV-1981

; Change History:
; 0-8	- interchanged FOR$L_SIG_LUN and FOR$A_SIG_RNS.  TNH 5-Jan-78
; 1-1	- modified for use by BASIC.  DGP 05-Apr-78
; 1-004	- Added a copyright notice.  JBS 29-NOV-78
; 1-005 - Gut this module to remove overhead.  DGP 09-Jan-79
; 1-006 - Remove the remaining unused symbols, as indicated by
;	   the BLISS cross-reference listing and BASIOELEM.  JBS 10-JAN-1979
; 1-007 - Add BAS$K_LUN_MAX, BAS$K_MAX_FOR_B for foreign buffers.  DGP 26-Mar-79
; 1-008	- Remove the PRINT statement for the new BLISS compiler.  JBS 08-OCT-1979
; 1-009 - Add BAS$K_CRLF.  DGP 06-Nov-79
; 1-010 - Add BAS$K_COND_SUC, BAS$K_FAILURE, BAS$K_SUCCESS, BAS$K_MAR_EXC.
;	  DGP 15-Feb-80
; 1-011 - Change COND_SUC from 3 to 2.  FM 19-SEP-80

; Define all symbols as if they were globals using the BAS$ prefix.
; Call definitions in MACRO-32 with:
;	$BASPAR



	$STRUCT	BAS,PAR			; Define $BASPAR

;+
; Control Z record for use with reading ENDFILE produced on PDP-11s
;-

	K CONTROL_Z,26	;B ASCII Control Z - ENDFILE record

;+
; Define a number of constants that are used for format characters, carriage
; control, and buffer sizes.  The format character constants are pushed by the 
; UPI level and read by the UDF level of I/O.
;-

	K COND_SUC,2		; conditional success status
	K FAILURE, 0		; failure status
	K SUCCESS,1		; success status
	K MAR_EXC,6		; margin exceeded status
	K BUF_EXC,8		; buffer exceeded status
	K CRLF,4		; CRLF found in string to be output
	K NULL,0		; dummy argument
	K COMMA_FOR,2		; comma format character in I/O
	K SEMI_FORM,1		; semicolon format character in I/O
	K NO_FORM,3		; no format character
	K LF, 1			; line feed character for carriage control
	K CR, 141		; carriage return character for carriage control
	K LUN_MAX, 256		; used by GET and PUT for foreign buffers
	K MAX_FOR_B, 127	; maximum LUN for foreign buffers
				; 127 was cosen because it doesn't set the sign
				; bit and allows room for more expansion

	E		; End of BAS$ symbol definitions.

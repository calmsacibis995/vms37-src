! ABSTRACT:
!
!	This module extracts a substring according to the BASIC-PLUS-2
!	syntax.  It finds the substring of a main string starting at the
!	character position specified by the second input parameter and
!	continues for the number of characters specified by the third
!	input parameter.  This substring is copied to the destination string.
!
! ENVIRONMENT: User mode, AST level or not or mixed

GLOBAL ROUTINE BAS$MID (DEST_DESC, 		! Pointer to destination descriptor

	CHAR_POS, 				! First character to be included
	SUB_LENGTH) : NOVALUE= 			! Length of the substring

! FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION:
!
!	This routine extracts the characters starting at the
!	character position in the source string specified by the input
!	parameter and continuing for the number of characters specified
!	by the input, and copies that substring
!	to the destination string (by JSB to STR$$COPY_R_R8) according
!	to the syntax of the class of the destination string.
!	If the input character position is < 1, 1 is used.  If
!	the input character position is > the length
!	of the source string, then the destination string becomes a null
!	string.  If the substring length is < 1 a null string is returned.
!	If character position + substring length - 1 > source string length
!	then the source string length is used.
!
! FORMAL PARAMETERS:
!
!	DEST_DESC.wt.dx		pointer to destination string descriptor
!	SRC_DESC.rt.dx		pointer to source string descriptor
!	CHAR_POS.rw.v		character position in src to start substring
!	SUB_LENGTH.rw.v		length of substring

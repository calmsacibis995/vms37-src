1 AUTOCONFIGURE
Automatically configures the device driver database.  It locates each
device unit physically attached to the system, loads the appropriate
driver, creates the appropriate data structures, and connects the driver
to the device's interrupt. 

Format
    AUTOCONFIGURE ALL

    AUTOCONFIGURE adapter-spec

		CMKRNL privilege required

Specifies the nexus (SBI arbitration line) or Slot number of the single
adapter that is to be configured. Can be an integer, or one of the names
listed by SHOW/ADAPTER. 
2 ALL
Indicates that all the standard devices attached to the system are
to be included in the configuration.
2 Qualifiers

/SELECT
Specifies that a subset of devices that is to be included in the
configuration.  The device name specified can consist of only a device
type and controller designation; it cannot include a unit number. 

Example

/EXCLUDE
Specifies that a subset of devices that are not to be included in the
configuration. The format is the same as /SELECT.

has been successfully configured. 
1 CONFIGURE
Prompts by "DEVICE>" and accepts UNIBUS device names.
Output is the set of CSR and vector addresses that AUTOCONFIGURE will use.

Form of input:

		device[[,n],p]	(Default n = 1, p = 0)

	  where n is the number of devices on the UNIBUS being
	  configured and p is the optional number of devices
	  on all previous UNIBUS in a mulitple UNIBUS system.
	  Note that p does not affect the addresses generated,
	  only the device names.

/INPUT = <file-spec> 	(D=SYS$INPUT)
Specifies where input is to be read from.
/OUTPUT = <file-spec>	(D=SYS$OUTPUT)
Specifies where output is to be written to.

to not reset controller names, so that the second input parameter is
unnecessary.

the appropriate driver if it is not currently loaded.  This is usually
used to add nonstandard devices and I/O drivers to a system.

device name is CSA1.
2 Qualifiers
/ADAPTER=adapter-spec
/NOADAPTER
Specifies the nexus number (SBI arbitration line) or slot number of the
adapter to which the device is connected.  The /NOADAPTER qualifier
specifies that the I/O driver does not handle a physical device; rather
it is a pseudo or test device driver.
/CSR=csr-address
Specifies the UNIBUS address of the first addressable location on the
controller (generally the controller status register) for the device. To
specify the address in octal or hexadecimal, precede the address with
a %O or %X respectively. 
/DRIVERNAME=driver-name
Specifies the name of the driver, as recorded in the driver prologue
table, to be loaded to handle the device's I/O requests.
/MAXUNITS=n
Specifies the maximum number of units to allow for connection to the
device controller.  If you omit this qualifier, the number of units
that can be connected to the controller defaults to the number
specified in the driver's prologue table.
/NUMVEC=n
Specifies the number of interrupt vectors for the device.  If you omit
this qualifier, the number of vectors defaults to 1.  The number
specified by the /VECTOR qualifier is the address of the first or
lowest vector.

device. To specify the address in octal or hexadecimal, precede the
address with a %O or %X respectively.
1 CREATE
Creates a file that can be used as a paging, swapping, or dump file.

SYS$UPDATE:SWAPFILES command procedure.
2 Qualifiers
/CONTIGUOUS (D)
Specifies the created file is to be contiguous.
/NOCONTIGUOUS
Specifies the created file is to be contiguous-best-try.
This is necessary if you are creating a secondary page or swap
file that spans volumes in a volume set.
/SIZE=block-count

default range checking is enabled.

command remain in the allowable range.  By default, the range checking
is enabled.

Format
    ENABLE CHECKS
1 EXIT
Exits the SYSGEN utility.  CTRL/Z or CONTINUE can also be used to exit SYSGEN.
1 HELP
The SYSGEN utility provides the capability to:

	- create and edit boot-time system parameter files		
	- modify dynamic system parameters				
	- load and connect I/O device drivers				
	- intialize and connect shared memory				
	- create and debug UNIBUS configurations			

To obtain help on a topic, type:

	HELP command [/qualifiers or parameters]

		CMKRNL privilege required
2 file-spec
Specifies the name of a file that is to be installed as a
secondary page or swap file.  This file can reside on any volume
that is mounted /SYSTEM.  The file should be contiguous for best
performance, but this is not necessary.

The CREATE command in this utility can be used to create a
secondary page or swap file.
2 Qualifiers
/PAGEFILE
Specifies that the file is to be installed as an additional pagefile.
All processes created after the pagefile is installed will use the
page file with the most available free space; processes created before
the additional pagefile is installed will continue to use the pagefile
it is assigned to.
/SWAPFILE
Specifies that the file is to be installed as another swapfile.  This
swapfile will augment the swapfile installed during the boot process.
1 LOAD
Loads an I/O driver into system memory so it can be used to handle
device requests. 

Format
   LOAD file-spec

If the file-spec is the same as a driver already loaded (the name
in the Driver Prologue Table is used for comaparison), no load takes
place.  If the driver is the same as a driver already loaded but the
file specification is different, the specified driver replaces the
existing driver. 

Example
    LOAD SYS$SYSTEM:XADRIVER

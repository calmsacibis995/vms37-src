! FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION:
!
!	This routine performs the basic scan of a directory,
!	searching for both relevant entries and free space.
!
! CALLING SEQUENCE:
!	DIR_SCAN (ARG1, ARG2)
!
! INPUT PARAMETERS:
!	ARG1: address of name block
!	ARG2: 0 if operation is FIND or REMOVE

!
! IMPLICIT INPUTS:
!	NONE
!
! OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
!	NONE
!
! IMPLICIT OUTPUTS:
!	FIRST_FREE: record number of first free directory entry
!	DIR_RECORD: record number of found entry
!	HIGHEST_VERSION: highest version number encountered
!	LOWEST_VERSION: lowest version number encountered

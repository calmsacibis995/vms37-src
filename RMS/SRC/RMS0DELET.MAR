	.SBTTL	RMS$DELETE - COMMON $DELETE SETUP AND DISPATCH ROUTINE

;++
; RMS$DELETE
;
;	RMS$DELETE - this routine performs common rab function setup followed
; 	       by dispatch to organization-dependent $delete code
;
; Calling sequence:
;
;	entered from exec as a result of user's calling sys$delete
;	(e.g., by using the $delete macro)
;
; Input Parameters:
;
;	ap	user's argument list addr
;
; Implicit Inputs:
;
;	the contents of the rab and related irab and ifab.
;
; Output Parameters:
;
;	r1	destroyed
;	r0	status code
;
; Implicit Outputs:
;
;	various fields of the rab are filled in to reflect
;	the status of the $delete operation. (see rms functional
; 	spec for a complete list.)
;
;	the irab is similarly deleted.
;
;	a completion ast is queued if specified in the user arglist.
;
; Completion Codes:
;
;	standard rms (see functional spec for list).
;
; Side Effects:
;
;	none

! FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION:
!	This routine restores the file access to what was originally requested
!	and restores mapping pointer
!
! CALLING SEQUENCE:
!	RESTORE_ACCESS()
!	called in kernel_mode
!
! INPUT PARAMETERS:
!	none
!
! IMPLICIT INPUTS:
!	CURRENT_WCB - address of current window control block
!	this code is locked into core because it runs at synch level
!	to synchronize with QIO code
!
! OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
!	none
!
! IMPLICIT OUTPUTS:
!	file access restored
!
! ROUTINE VALUE:

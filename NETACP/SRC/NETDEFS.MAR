;		NETACP.
;
; AUTHOR:	Alan D. Eldridge, CREATION DATE: 13-APR-1979
;
; MODIFIED BY:
;
;	V02-03	ADE0003		A.Eldridge		31-Dec-1981
;		Delete the obsolete TR$_REQXMT and TR$_CANCEL function codes.
;
;	V02-02	ADE0002		A.Eldridge		31-Dec-1981
;		Increased VMS limit on the maximum object name from 8 to 12.
;
;	V02-01	ADE0001		A.Eldridge		20-Dec-1981
;		Updated the $NETSYMDEF macro to include NET$V_TIMER.
